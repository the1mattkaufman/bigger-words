This repo contains sample code for use with my talk "Building a backend for your app with Firebase".

This talk walks through how to migrate a simple web application to Firebase, including:

1. Hosting it on Firebase Hosting
2. Authenticating users with Firebase Auth
3. Working with data in Firestore
4. Using a Firebase Function to move functions server side
5. Exposing a Firebase Function as a Restful Web Service
