This repo contains sample code for use with my talk "Building a backend for your app with Firebase".

This talk walks through how to migrate a simple web application to Firebase, including:

1. Host it on Firebase Hosting
2. Use a Firebase Function to store our JavaScript functions
3. Load our data in Firestore
4. Query Firestore with a Firebase Function
5. Update values in Firestore with a Firebase Function
6. Expose a Firebase Function as a Restful Web Service
